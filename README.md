A Framework for Model-Backed Generators


## Installation

* As the repository is in early development stage, you should do a development install as follows

    ```bash
      cd <repo-dir>
      pip install -e .
    ```
  
* The requirements list `tensorflow==1.13.2`. If you want to use the GPU version, 
you can manually install `tensorflow-gpu==1.13.2` using pip. Make sure CUDA version is 10.

## OOPSLA 2019

The system used for the [OOPSLA '19 paper](https://2019.splashcon.org/details/splash-2019-oopsla/51/AutoPandas-Neural-Backed-Generators-for-Program-Synthesis) 
is available in the `oopsla-2019-autopandas` branch.
Atlas is a generalization of that system. The porting of AutoPandas onto Atlas is ongoing.
